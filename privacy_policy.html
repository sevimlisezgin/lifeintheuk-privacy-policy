    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>This application ("Turkish Life in the UK Test") collects minimal, anonymous usage data to improve the app experience. We do not collect any personally identifiable information (PII).</p>
    
    <h3>1.1 Analytics Data (Anonymous)</h3>
    <p>We collect anonymous analytics data using Firebase Analytics and Cloud Firestore to understand how users interact with our app. This data includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Device ID:</strong> A randomly generated unique identifier (not linked to your personal identity or device hardware ID)</li>
        <li><strong>Usage statistics:</strong> Which features you use (e.g., test attempts, button clicks)</li>
        <li><strong>App interactions:</strong> Anonymous data about premium feature views and interactions</li>
        <li><strong>Purchase status:</strong> Whether premium features have been purchased (no payment details)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Important:</strong> This data is completely anonymous and cannot be used to identify you personally. No names, email addresses, phone numbers, or other personal information is collected.</p>
    
    <h2>2. Data Storage</h2>
    <p><strong>Local Storage:</strong> All test progress, scores, and user preferences are stored locally on your device only. This data never leaves your device except as described below.</p>
    <p><strong>Cloud Storage (Anonymous):</strong> Anonymous usage statistics are stored securely in Firebase Cloud Firestore (Google Cloud Platform) for analytics purposes. This data is encrypted in transit and at rest.</p>
    
    <h2>3. How We Use Your Data</h2>
    <p>The anonymous analytics data we collect is used exclusively to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Understand how users interact with the app</li>
        <li>Improve app features and user experience</li>
        <li>Analyze which features are most valuable to users</li>
        <li>Identify and fix technical issues</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not sell, rent, or share your data with third parties for marketing purposes.</p>
    
    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>This app uses the following third-party services:</p>
    
    <h3>4.1 Firebase (Google)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Firebase Analytics:</strong> Anonymous usage analytics</li>
        <li><strong>Cloud Firestore:</strong> Anonymous data storage for analytics</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Firebase is operated by Google and complies with GDPR and other privacy regulations. For more information, see <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Firebase Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
    
    <h3>4.2 Apple In-App Purchases</h3>

    <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Anonymous analytics data is retained indefinitely for business analysis purposes. Since this data is completely anonymous and cannot identify you, it does not pose any privacy risk.</p>
    
    <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Since we do not collect any personally identifiable information, traditional data subject rights (access, deletion, portability) do not apply. However:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You can delete the app at any time, which removes all local data from your device</li>
        <li>Anonymous analytics data cannot be linked back to you and therefore cannot be deleted on a per-user basis</li>

    </ul>
